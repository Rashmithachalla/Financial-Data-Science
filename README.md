# Financial Data Science Project

This project applies **data science and machine learning techniques to financial datasets** to explore market trends, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights.

The notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of handling financial data: from collection and preprocessing to visualization, modeling, and evaluation.

## 🔑 Objectives

* Collect stock market and financial data
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
* Apply **statistical models (regression, time series forecasting)**
* Test **machine learning models** for predictive analysis
* Extract insights useful for **investment and risk management**

---

## 📊 Key Methods & Analysis

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation** → handling missing values, formatting time series
* **Exploratory Analysis** → price trends, moving averages, volatility study
* **Regression Models** → linear regression for trend detection
* **Time Series Forecasting** → ARIMA / Prophet-style models for price prediction
* **Clustering/Classification (if applicable)** → grouping assets based on risk/return
* **Portfolio-style Insights** → risk-return visualization and interpretation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Time Series**: ARIMA, Prophet (if installed)
* **Jupyter Notebook** for reproducibility
